					<li data-theme="b">Many critics of the play view Hamlet's inability to act on his vengeance and 
					often sad reflection on the events that have effected him as a tragic flaw that leads to his death.
					Would this be considered accurate in your opinion or is this the only logical way in which Hamlet could 
					react given the circumstances?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though throughout the play it is quite obvious to the audience that Hamlet is not the strongest person mentally as he cannot seem to convince himself to seek vengeance.`
					<li data-theme="c">He always seems to be putting it off seemingly hoping for an easier way to avenge his fathers death.`
					<li data-theme="d">Many critics of the play argue that this attribute is the essential downfall of Hamlet and the ultimate cause of his death, however this idea is quite problematic.`
					<li data-theme="c">Human actions, especially as shown in the play, often have unintended results than what is usually planned. Even those with the best intentions and the most willing to act cannot always be assured of the outcome of their plans.`
					<li data-theme="d">To say that Hamlet's flaws are the reason he died in the way he did would be wrong, as anyone could have fallen into the same situation by making the wrong mistake at the wrong time.`
					<li data-theme="c">The fact that he failed to act for so long, and that when he eventually died he tragically died is just convenient for critics of the play, as they can argue that it was inevitable based on his character.`
					<li data-theme="d">Instead it was just an accident, that occurred by chance, when really their was nothing his so called flaw could have changed either way.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">During the play Hamlet claims to the audience that any act of madness by him is nothing more of an act
					done to carry out his plan of seeking vengeance, however his character is so convincing in this portrayal that it is believable 
					that at times he is slipping in and out of delusion and madness. What is your opinion on this matter?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the play Hamlet acts extremely outrageous at times, however it for the most part seems calculated, and he manages to back up his sanity with strong spoken soliloquies.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">To an educated audience it would be more clear that their is a method to his madness, however one cannot go as far to say that he is completely sane either.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He is faced with a very stressful situation as his father was betrayed and murdered, and his mother has betrayed his trust as well as she married his father's murderer.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He must cope with his father's loss all without seemingly anyone to trust.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It seems as if in his situation his pretend madness may be more driven by the stress he undertakes, and it is possible that he may in-fact be bordering madness.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though he can regain sanity after the brief times of intense pretend madness, it would not be a stretch to believe that any further bizarre and stressful events in his life could push him over the edge into actual madness.</li>
